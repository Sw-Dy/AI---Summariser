Global warming is a critical global issue caused mainly by human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial emissions, which release greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. This results in rising global temperatures, melting polar ice, rising sea levels, and extreme weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires. It also leads to ocean acidification, harming marine life and coral reefs, and contributes to food and water scarcity by affecting agriculture and glacial water sources. Human health is at risk due to heatwaves and the spread of vector-borne diseases. Economically, global warming impacts agriculture, insurance, and infrastructure. Efforts like the Paris Agreement aim to limit temperature rise through emission reductions and a shift to renewable energy. While technological advances and lifestyle changes can help mitigate its effects, developing nations need support to transition sustainably. Addressing global warming requires urgent, collective global action to ensure a livable future.
